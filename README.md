✨ **This workspace has been generated by [Nx, a Smart, fast and extensible build system.](https://nx.dev)** ✨

It is preconfigured to use the following tech stack:
1. [Vite](https://vitejs.dev) - is a modern front-end build tool providing instant server start with on-demand file serving over native ESM and no bundling required, lightning-fast hot module replacement (HMR) that maintains speed regardless of app size, rich features including out-of-the-box support for TypeScript, JSX, CSS, and more.
2. [MUI v5.x](https://mui.com/material-ui/getting-started/overview/) - is an open-source React component library that implements Google's Material Design providing comprehensive collection of prebuilt components out of the box. This demo application also comes with a SeaportOPX customized theme.
3. [MobX v6.x](https://mobx.js.org/README.html) - for state management.
4. [React IoC](https://github.com/gnaeus/react-ioc) - a very small heirarchical dependency injection library for React
5. [React Router v6.x](https://reactrouter.com/en/main) - a bare-bones routing example is presented in the application which allows for protected routes. 
6. [Echarts for React](https://github.com/hustcc/echarts-for-react) - React wrapper for [Echarts](https://echarts.apache.org/en/index.html)
